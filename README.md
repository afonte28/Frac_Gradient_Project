# Frac_Gradient_Project

The purpose of this project is to create a method for automating open well head and Initial Shut-In Pressure caclculations. The Jupyter notebook details the specifics behind the calculations and the python script runs the calculations. A small user interface using tkinter runs with the python script to display some graphic info.

To run the script, download KODA_Frac_Calcs.py and run using python. The code will prompt you to point to a file(s) with Frac Data in .csv format. Check the .csv file in the data folder to make sure the data is in the same format. Once the code is done running it will generate a summary file for each well and stage in a .csv file in the same folder.
