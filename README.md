# Frac_Gradient_Project

The purpose of this project is to create a method for automating open well head and Initial Shut-In Pressure caclculations. There will be a Jupyter notebook that details out the specifics behind the calculations and a python script that will run the calculations. I will attempt to create a small user interface, potentially using tkinter, that will run with the python script.

To run the script, download KODA_Frac_Calcs.py and run using python. The code will prompt you to point to a file(s) with Frac Data in .csv format. Once the code is done running it will generate a summary file for each well and stage in a .csv file in the same folder.
